# des-core
Work in Progress!
Files can be found in ./src

The idea is to create a a high performance disrete event simulation core specialised in manufacturing and transport/logistics processes.
Overall I aim for a high amount of low level functionality that be orchestrated using an easier language such as python. 

# Current Status
- Single Station partially implemented
- Simulation Orchestrator partially implememted
- Processor partially implemented

# Next Steps
- Implement Public API
- Buffer
- Parallel Station
- Transport
- Flow-Line
- Crane
- Modules: Time, ParallelTime, Disruptions
